# ResExtras
This Bukkit/Spigot plugin is an extension to the already popular [Residence](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/residence-1-7-10-up-to-1-12.11480/) plugin.

### Installation
* Make sure [Residence](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/residence-1-7-10-up-to-1-12.11480/) is installed
* Simple drag and drop
* Edit config.yml for efficiency and needs
* Done

### What does it do?
ResExtras adds more flags to [Residence](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/residence-1-7-10-up-to-1-12.11480/) to really customize what you want
your property to do. For example, don't want pigs to spawn? No problem just set pig to false. Or say you have a mob grinder and spiders are clogging it up,
just turn spider to false.
